##Discription:
This project showcases the process of consuming a public REST API, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API, to fetch and display real-time weather data in a structured format. It leverages Java's HttpClient to send HTTP requests and org.json to parse JSON responses. Users can input a city name, and the application retrieves weather details such as temperature, humidity, and overall conditions. The core functionality is implemented in the WeatherAPIClient class, which handles user input, makes API requests, and processes the responses efficiently. The project utilizes org.json as a lightweight JSON parsing library and integrates a free public weather API that provides global weather data. The HttpClient is responsible for sending GET requests to the API, ensuring seamless data retrieval. Developed and executed in Eclipse IDE, this project offers a practical approach to understanding API consumption, HTTP communication, and JSON parsing in Java.
